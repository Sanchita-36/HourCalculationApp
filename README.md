# HourCalculationApp
This app has been built as a practice app learnt from a course. 
Idea behind this app is to calculate hours depending on one's hourly wage to buy a particular item of a particular price.

Configurations: 
Swift 5, Xcode version: 11.5 , MacOS version: 10.15.7

How it works: 
On launching the App, enter your hourly wage, enter item's price and click on calculate button, 
the calculated value shows in the label in terms of hours.
The app shows how many hours will you have to work to buy a particular item of a specific price, depending on your hourly wage.  

Note*: The app has a Unit Test created

I am still a learner, any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you.
